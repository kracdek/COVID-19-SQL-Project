# COVID-19 SQL Data Exploration Project

## Introduction
This covid-19 analysis was one of the detailed project I worked on using the dataset from WHO.TThe Covid-19 pandemic affected the World on a Global scale. This analysis purpose was to know the effect of pandemic in each continents, drilling down to countries to determine the extent of severity of the pandemic.

## Tools
This project uses following languages/tools
* Microsoft Excel : To understand the dataset we are dealing with.
* MySQL : For further analysis.
* Tableau Public: For further visualization

## Project 
We're looking at global Covid-19 deaths data and comparing those numbers/percentages between countries or continent, and visualizing them. This repository Data Analysis and Visualisation is performed to show trends or comparison of Covid-19 deaths data.

## Data

The data for this assignment can be viewed from the link given below:

   - [Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
   
The file contains the data frame with all the COVID-19 cases worldwide information. Here is aquick glance of the following columns I used:

### Columns

* `iso_code`	ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 â€“ three-letter country codes
* `continent`	Continent of the geographical location
* `location`	Geographical location
* `date`	Date of observation
* `population`	Population in 2020

* `new_cases`	New confirmed cases of COVID-19
* `total_deaths`	Total deaths attributed to COVID-19
* `new_deaths`	New deaths attributed to COVID-19



## Data Preparation
This step is used to process data cleaning and ensuring that the dataset is free from errors and unwanted outliers when starting the analysis.
- Explore and observe data.
- Check for and treat missing values.
- Transform data-format types.
- Deleted unwanted columns such as Hospitalized Patients, Mortality rate e.t.c
- Deleted dates after the May 2021.
  
Further analysis took place in MySQL Workbench.
